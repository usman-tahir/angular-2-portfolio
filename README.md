# VisualJSON

## Introduction
VisualJSON is a single page application that allows for the creation of JSON data, through the use of drag and drop components that can be rearranged to create JSON-like structure, with all the basic features that normally generated JSON offers.

Components are created for key/value pairings, and they can take on all the normal data types that JSON supports. These components can be dragged and dropped within other components, to represent "hierarchies" of data created by JSON.

Version 1.0.0 of this application will support basic drag and drop functionality, as well as output of a JSON file.
